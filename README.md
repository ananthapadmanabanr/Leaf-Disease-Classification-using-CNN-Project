Problem Statement:

"Developing an accurate supervised learning classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting and classifying corn leaf diseases based on leaf images."

Problem Description:

The objective of this project is to design and train a robust supervised learning classification model using CNN for accurately detecting and classifying different types of corn leaf diseases based on images of corn leaves. The model will be trained on a dataset consisting of labeled images of healthy corn leaves and various types of leaf diseases such as common rust, gray leaf spot, northern leaf blight, and others.

The primary goal is to develop a model that can effectively learn the visual patterns and features associated with different corn leaf diseases, enabling it to classify new leaf images into appropriate disease categories. This model can assist farmers and agricultural experts in early detection and timely intervention to mitigate the impact of diseases on corn crops, thereby improving crop yield and reducing economic losses.

The success of this project will be measured based on the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in classifying the corn leaf diseases. The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and compared against existing methods or baseline models to assess its effectiveness.

By accurately classifying corn leaf diseases, this project aims to contribute to the field of precision agriculture, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about disease management strategies, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall crop health.

Plant diseases pose a severe threat to global  food security. Timely identification and treatment can significantly reduce these threats. Your challenge is to develop a model capable of identifying specific diseases affecting plant leaves. Your model should be able to analyze images of leaves and accurately classify the disease present (if any).
there are 9 classes in this dataset. build a classifier model to detect the class labels.
